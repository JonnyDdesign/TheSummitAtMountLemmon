            The Summit is the geographical center of the the
            <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=25678">Mount Lemmon</a> Ski Area. 
            It has a wide variety of terrain, including beginner trails, intermediate trails, expert trails, and a full scale halfpipe.
            The Lowers consist of beginner trails, as well as many
            intermediate trails mixed with some advanced runs. There are four
            lifts out of the base area: Lift 1, which services a beginner/learning
            area; Lift 2, which services more advanced beginner terrain, along with
            intermediate runs; Lift 3, which services all intermediate to advanced trails;
            Left 4, which services the Playground, our version of play in the snow.
            The Playground is designed to challenge riders and allow them to be creative with various jumps, rails, and our halfpipe.
            All chairs require each rider to have their own lift ticket.
          </p>

            In 2022, The Summit at Mount Lemmon hosted the first annual Tucson Ski Competition! It was the first
            local action sports tour with many top athletes in attendance. The Summit continues to
            host the event annually in the 2nd or 3rd weekend in January (depending upon weather).
            Many of the top athletes in action sports from around the world
            continue to participate in the Tucson Ski Competition. We look forward to you coming out
            to support and cheer on your favorite athletes.
